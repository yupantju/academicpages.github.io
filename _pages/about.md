I am an assistant professor of [Center of Applied Mathematics](http://cam.tju.edu.cn/) at Tianjin University. Before joining Tianjin University, I was an CLE Moore Instructor at MIT. I finished my Ph.D. at Duke University under the supervision of [Prof. Lenny Ng](https://services.math.duke.edu/~ng/) in 2017. I graduated from Nankai University in 2012.
